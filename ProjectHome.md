Please consider using [Sitemaps](http://www.sitemaps.org/) or this [semantic sitemap extension](http://sw.deri.org/2007/07/sitemapextension/) or [ResourceSync](http://www.openarchives.org/rs/resourcesync) instead of OAI-PMH.

Sitemaps that lead to Schema.org vocabulary-based Linked Data is an especially effective alternative. The synchronization aspects of OAI-PMH can generally be served more effectively by using proper HTTP cache headers on individual http URI-identified resources and/or providing periodic datadumps (especially as GZipped N-Triples).
